## Objective
Analyze lead generation data, answer business-driven questions, and provide actionable insights using dashboards and predictive analysis.
This project was completed as part of a **Data Analyst skills assessment** asked by recruiter from Antarctica Global - The Windows

#1. Answers to the following questions:

1. Lead Generation Efficiency  
   - Calculated lead generation efficiency for each associate as total leads divided by total time spent on lead generation.  
   - Identified the associate with the highest efficiency.

2. Daily Performance Variability  
   - Computed the standard deviation of daily leads for each associate.  
   - Determined which associate showed the highest variability in daily performance.

3. Time Management Analysis  
   - Analyzed the relationship between average time per lead and total leads generated per day.  
   - Evaluated whether a significant correlation exists.

4. Impact of Daily Team Reviews  
   - Compared average leads generated on days when team reviews were attended versus missed.  
   - Calculated the percentage difference in performance for each associate.

5. Incomplete Leads Trend Analysis  
   - Applied a linear regression model to analyze the trend of incomplete leads over time.  
   - Identified improvements or deteriorations in lead completion.

6. Performance Consistency  
   - Calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) for daily leads generated.  
   - Identified the most consistent performer.

7. High-Performance Days Analysis  
   - Identified the top 10% of days with the highest lead generation for each associate.  
   - Analyzed the average time spent on lead generation during these days.

8. Impact of Longer Lead Generation Time  
   - Evaluated whether a time threshold exists beyond which lead generation increases significantly.  
   - Determined the optimal time window for maximizing leads.

9. Comparative Day Analysis  
   - Compared average leads generated on weekdays versus weekends.  
   - Assessed performance differences based on the day of the week.

10. Predictive Analysis  
    - Built a simple linear regression model to predict leads based on time spent.  
    - Evaluated model accuracy by comparing predicted and actual values.

#2. Dashboarding

Create a clear, beautiful, concise and static dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the associates' performance based on the provided dataset, including:

1. Performance Trend with Attendance  
   - Line chart showing daily leads generated on days when team reviews were attended versus missed for each associate.

2. Time vs. Leads Heatmap  
   - Heatmap illustrating the relationship between time spent on lead generation and the number of leads generated for each associate.

3. Monthly Performance Comparison  
   - Bar chart comparing total leads generated by each associate on a monthly basis.

4. Daily Incomplete Leads Trend  
   - Line chart visualizing daily trends in incomplete leads for each associate.

5. Time Distribution Analysis  
   - Box plot analyzing the distribution of time spent on lead generation activities for each associate.

6. Efficiency & Pattern Highlights  
   - Bar charts and scatter plots used to highlight significant trends, efficiency differences, and performance patterns.
